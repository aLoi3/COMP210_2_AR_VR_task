## Sword swing slash wave

I will be trying to make a mechanic where player has a sword and by swinging it a wave going to come out in the direction of the swing.



## Key features
* Only one controller is a sword
* Swing a sword to make a wave come out in that direction

## Interesting ideas to add
* Charge the sword by standing in a "stance"
* Charged sword makes a bigger wave.

## Non-VR games that have it

* Destiny 2
* Hollow knight
